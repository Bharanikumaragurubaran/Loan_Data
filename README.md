# Loan_Data
This is just a simple project which I done after completing my Data Analysis course from Udemy.
## Process
1. Here I used a very dataset i.e., Loan Data which had many missing values, complex data etc.,
2. My Aim is to simply this dataset using Numpy
3. Using Numpy I have converted each and every column values to numbers so that it will be easier to do analysis.
4. I have found the missing values and substituted them with appropriate values and simplfied complex data.
